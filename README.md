# JobSearchScorecard
A smart-phone app that guides you through the job-hunt, helping you stay organized, inspired and motivated.  As you work your way through the recommended steps, you can log your activities, keep notes, earn points and even hear words of encouragement.

The search steps are based upon the Job Transition Support Group at Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, Minnesota (jobtransition.net)

This app was created by Stephen J. Rawlins (call me Steve).  I am a C# developer living in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
