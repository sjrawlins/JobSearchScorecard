# JobSearchScorecard
A smart-phone app that guides you in the job-hunt, helping you stay organized and motivated when in the job hunt.  You earn points, and hear words of encouragement, as you proceed down a tested, proven path to landing that next job.

My goal is to learn `Xamarin Forms` and to publish a **cross-platform** application (i.e. commmon code running on iOS, Android and Windows Phone).

The search steps are based upon the Wooddale Church's Job Transition Support Group.

This app was created by Stephen J. Rawlins (call me Steve).  I am a C# developer living in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
