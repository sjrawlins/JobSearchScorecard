# JobSearchScorecard
A smart-phone app that helps you organize and stay motivated when in the job hunt.

My goal is to learn `Xamarin Forms` and to publish a **cross-platform** application (i.e. commmon code running on iOS, Android and Windows Phone).

The app is loosely based upon the Wooddale Church's Job Transition Support Group.

This app was created by Stephen J. Rawlins (call me Steve).  I am a C# developer living in Minnesota, USA.
